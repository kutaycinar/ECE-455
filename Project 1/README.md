# Project 1: Traffic Light System

The Traffic Light System simulates vehicle traffic on a one-way, one-lane road with a simplified
intersection that has a single traffic light. The system has three main components:

- Potentiometer (Traffic Flow Adjustment):
- Traffic Light
- LEDs (Representing Cars)

## Report

Completed lab report I've written detailing the system and my proposed design solution in-depth is available [here](./docs/ECE%20455%20Project%201%20Report.pdf).

My code is available under [./src/main.c](./src/main.c)
